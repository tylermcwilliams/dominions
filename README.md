#SUMMARY

Dominions is a Vintage Story server project aimed at providing a hub for collective story telling, world-building and roleplaying. 

##The setting is the sum of the community's contributions.

Leaving the setting open to the community allows for great diversity and completeness. People can contribute as much as they please; 
this includes anything from simple interactions via your ingame character, to entire ecosystems and civilizations.
The rules for contributing to the world of Dominions are there only to provide a center of gravity, and are meant to help
keep the setting consistent. 

##Explore the world through the eyes of an ingame character...

...or play God in the world-building and modding effort. Anyone is welcome in our community, and our open-ended nature 
means that you decide what to make of your stay. There is room for speculative biology, anthropology, theology and legend. The possibilites
are endless.

#PREMISE

The world being built needs to feel consistent and unique, for this reason we made a general guideline. To steer the community's creativity
toward a shared direction and avoid conflicting paths.

##The precepts we follow:

###No references to Earth or her affairs. 
Inspiration is inevitable, and common naming for things, such as plants, animals and objects, are okay.

###Stay with the times. 
This is a low fantasy setting with ancient overtones. Huge differnces in technology from what exists in the world are discouraged.

###Immersion and realism should strongly influence your choices.
Magic and general obsurdism has a place in the setting. However, we ask to mindful when coming up with the aforementioned elements. 

###Direct contradictions with the existing content should be avoided. 
Some things will slip, moreso as the amount of content scales. Please try your best to research what already exists to find out if your idea directly contradicts someone else's.
